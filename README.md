**Word Game**
===================================================================

**Word Game** is a web-based trivia app that allows you to test your word knowledge in a hangman-type game. The pastry theme gives it a fun twist and leaves you hungry for more!

The application is built with:
===================================================================
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

**How it works:**
===================================================================

The game begins when the page loads. To make a guess, press a letter key on your keyboard. You can only guess a letter once. Incorrect guesses are counted against you and take a turn. Duplicate guesses are not counted against you. Your remaining guesses are tracked on the screen, along with the incorrected guesses, and the correct guesses as the word is built. The game is over when the word is guessed correctly or when the number of guesses is zero.
